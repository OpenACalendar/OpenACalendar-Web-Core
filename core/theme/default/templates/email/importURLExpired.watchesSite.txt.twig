Hello {{ user.username }},

We used to import data from the following resource:

{{importurl.url}}

But we are not sure it is up to date. 

We want to make sure that the data we have is up to date, so we have temporarily 
disabled it.

If you can confirm it is up to date, please can you visit the site and log in and 
press "enable" to re-enable it.
{{ config.getWebSiteDomainSecure(currentSite.slug) }}/importurl/{{ importurl.slug }}

Thanks,
{{ currentSite.title }} {{ config.siteTitle }}

ps. 
To change which emails you get, click:
{{ config.getWebIndexDomainSecure() }}/you/emails/{{ user.id }}/{{ generalSecurityCode }}
To stop watching {{ currentSite.title }} click:.</p
{{ config.getWebSiteDomainSecure(currentSite.slug) }}/stopWatchingFromEmail/{{ user.id }}/{{ stopCode }}
