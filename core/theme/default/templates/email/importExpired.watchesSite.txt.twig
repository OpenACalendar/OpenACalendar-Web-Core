Hello {{ user.username }},

We were importing events into the group: {{ group.title }}

We were checking regularly for events on: {{import.url}}

We haven't had confirmation for a while that this source is correct. To make sure our events data is good, we like to check regularly that a source is correct and still useful.

Can you confirm this source is still correct?

Do so at: {{ config.getWebSiteDomainSecure(currentSite.slug) }}/import/{{ import.slug }}/enablefromnotification/{{  user.id }}/{{ generalSecurityCode }}

If this source is confirmed as correct, we will carry on checking regularly for events information there.

If this source is no longer correct or no longer useful, you can just ignore this email.

Thanks,
{{ currentSite.title }}{% if not config.isSingleSiteMode %} {{ config.installTitle }}{%  endif %}


ps. 
To change which emails you get, click:
{{ config.getWebIndexDomainSecure() }}/you/emails/{{ user.id }}/{{ generalSecurityCode }}
To stop watching {{ currentSite.title }} click:
{{ config.getWebSiteDomainSecure(currentSite.slug) }}/stopWatchingFromEmail/{{ user.id }}/{{ stopCode }}
